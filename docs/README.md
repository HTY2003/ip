# Frappe User Guide

![screenshot](./screenshot.png)

Frappe is a simple CLI chatbot that can be used to store simple tasks,
such as todos, deadlines and events.

Additionally, you can search for tasks, and mark them as completed.

When you're done adding tasks, your tasks are automatically saved and
ready for you when you start Frappe again.

## Quick Start

* Ensure you have Java 17 installed on your computer.
    * Download the latest `ip.jar` file [here](https://github.com/HTY2003/ip/releases)
* Copy the file to the folder you want to use as your home folder for Frappe.
* We recommend creating a dedicated folder for the file, as the program will create and store save files in the same
  folder
* Open a terminal, cd into your folder, and run the program using the command below:
    * ```java -jar ip.jar```
* Youâ€™re ready to start using Frappe!
* Refer to the Features and Command Summary below for more details on each command

## Displaying all tasks using `list`

You can list all the tasks using the `list` command!

Tasks are shown in the order they are added,
followed by a task type indicator (`T`odo, `D`eadline or `E`vent),
their completion status (`[X]` means done), and the task itself.

## Finding tasks using `find`

Too many tasks?

Using the `find` command, you can search for all tasks that contain your search term in their print
output (the information you see when you use `list`).

Format: `find <search_term>`

Example: `find work`

Expected Output:

```
__________________________________________________
Here are the matching tasks in your list:
1. [T][ ] math homework
__________________________________________________
```

## Ending program using `bye`

To exit the program, use the `bye` command.

Always try to use this command to exit the program, or your save data may be corrupted!

Format: `bye`
